# PhysRev
The PhysRev website is a tool aimed at helping GCSE physics students better prepare for their examss in and outside of a school evnironemnt.
The website is intended to be used by both teaching staff and school pupils. The pupils will be able to answer exam questions on the many 
modules in physics GCSE and receive immediate feedback on their attemppts. The website will provide an ideal method and solution to the problem
giving pupils the most efficient way to answer their problems. The site provides a class for the pupils to join (currently one of three) in
which they are able to compete against other pupils on a leaderboard to assist in motivating the pupils to study. 

The teaching staff have the ability to add their own questions to the database for their pupils if they feel their is a particular topic that
there pupils should have more of a focus on. The teachers will also have access to the class area where they are able to view the current progress
of there class. The questions mark themselves and will reduce the marking load for teachers as well as providing statistical feedback on how pupils are preforming.
