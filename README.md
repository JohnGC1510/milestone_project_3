# PhysRev
The PhysRev website is a tool aimed at helping GCSE physics students better prepare for their exams in and outside of a school environment.
The website is intended to be used by both teaching staff and school pupils. The pupils will be able to answer exam questions on the many 
modules in physics GCSE and receive immediate feedback on their attempts. The website will provide an ideal method and solution to the problem
giving pupils the most efficient way to answer their problems. The site provides a class for the pupils to join (currently one of three) in
which they are able to compete against other pupils on a leader board to assist in motivating the pupils to study. 

The teaching staff have the ability to add their own questions to the database for their pupils if they feel there is a particular topic that
there pupils should have more of a focus on. The teachers will also have access to the class area where they are able to view the current progress
of their class. The questions mark themselves and will reduce the marking load for teachers as well as providing statistical feedback on how pupils are preforming.

## **Data Structure**
---
A NoSQL database was used for this project. Please see the tables below for more information on each data type and my reason for using it and my database diagram which clearly shows the relationships between my different collections. 
### Database
<img src="static/images/questions_data.PNG" height="750px" width="500px"> <img src="static/images/user_data.PNG" height="750px" width="500px">
### Database Relationships - Inital 
![Database-relationships](static/images/db_relationships.png)
### Final Database and Relationships
The main changes in the final version fo the database is to the students collection.

Student users should be able to answer a question and if they get it incorret then a method should be displayed, if they get it correct then both the method and correct answer should be displayed. 

This was very diffiuclt to acheive with my intial database hence I changed to using 3 arrays, questions_unaswered is filled upon account creation with all question_ids from questions currently in the database and the other two arrays are initialised empty. question_ids are moved from questions_unanswered to either question_correct and questions_incorrect depending on the users response. This then allowed me a way to change what the user saw depending on the answer given.

The first_name and surname were added to the class section to allow for easier sorting of the students in the class section, however upon reflection this addition to the database was not required and can be removed as the duplication of this data is completly uneeded. 
![Database-relationships](static/images/final_db_relationships.PNG)
### Current Issues with database
The current database has 3 main issues:
1. Duplicated data - I have duplicated username, first_name and surname in the users and students collections to allow for easier coding at points. I have duplicated class in users, teachers and students, class only needs to be in one of these collections.  
2. Uneeded collections and data - As the class collection in teacher is duplicated the teacher collection is actually not required. The percentage_correct and current_grade information does not need to be stored in the collection as it can always be dynamically generated from questions_answered and questions_correct.
3. Student questions solution unideal - This soltuion lead to a complicated series of for loops and if statements in the all-questions section to allow me to display content as desired, re-writing the database could greatly simplfiy the all_quiestions.html. 
### Future Improvements to Database
1.	Duplicated data - To fix this issue I would remove first_name, surname and username from the students collection. I would also remove class from both the teachers and students collection. This would mean needing to change pages where student names are accessed from the student collection and adjusting my sorting function.
2.	Unneeded collections and data - I would entirely remove the teachers collection. Additionally I would remove the current_grade and percentage_correct values from the student. The values are already generated inside the program and can just be calculated when they are required as this uses much less memory than a database request.
3.	Student questions solutions unideal - I could completely change the students and questions collection. One solution would be to replace the students and questions collection with 2 collections - a table of questions and a table to record student answers. The student answers collection would store a record every time a student answers a question. The collection would store the students unqiue id, the unique question id, a boolean variable that indicated if the question was correctly answered and a score based on the weight of the question. You could use the boolean value to easily change the view and the number of items in the collection would be the number of questions attempted. Both collections being a table would you to access all questions at once; allowing for the submission of multiple questions.


## Technologies Used
---
This project used the languages Python (alongisde Jinjia tempalting), HTML5, javascript and CSS3.

- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) - The jQuery library was used on all pages.
- [GitPod](https://gitpod.io/workspaces/) - The entire website was developed in GitPod
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) - GitHub was used to store the project and to deploy it using the master branch on the github site
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - The grid structure was used to structure the website and make it responsive and some default items in bootstrap were used as a starting point.
- [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - Font Awesome was used for various icons throughout the side.

## Testing
---
1. Bug â€“ My initial data structure made it difficult to present the question, question method or the solution based on if the student had not answered the question, had attempted it incorrectly or gotten the question correct as there was no unique way to determine if a student had answered a question. An initial change was adding an array to the students table storing the question_id of the questions the students had attempted. This appeared to work initially as when a question was answered the solution appeared and the rest of the questions remained unchanged, however this had its own bugs. Answers/unanswered questions/question methods displaying multiple times if answered incorrectly multiple times or multiple correct questions were answered as I was looping over the array of questions answered and over all questions without appropriate if conditions.  

Solution - I removed the question_answered array from the student table and replaced this with 3 arrays questions_unanswered, questions_correct and questions_incorrect. When a student was initially created the i_d of all current questions in the database would be added to the questions_unanswered array and the questions_correct, questions_incorrect arrays were both initialised empty. Question ids are moved between the arrays based on how the student answers the question. This allowed me to create a set of if conditions that covered all possible circumstances of answers (all correct, all incorrect, some correct etc.) which meant no duplication of methods/answers as there was always 1 unique outcome for each if condition. This now functions as intended with students able to attempt questions multiple times and no duplicates of a question/method/answer ever appear.  

2. Bug â€“ In this program only teachers and admin are meant to be able to add/edit/delete question. Students were unable to navigate to the page directly using their view however if, when logged in, the students typed the address to the directly into the address bar (/edit_question) they were able to access the CRUD functionality of the site which was not intended for them.  

Solution â€“ Added an if condition at the start of appropriate routes that checks if user is of the correct type to access this page. If not then the users are directed to a page saying they do not have permission to access that page and redirects them back to their profile page.  

### **Code Validation**

### **User Story Testing**
1. As a student I want to easily be able to locate the questions I would like to practice 

Achieved, the student has a search bar based on the questions name and the question itself to allow filtering. In addition, there is a modules page that allows the students to filter the questions by the different GCSE modules.  

2. As a student I want to see how I am performing compared to other users: 

Achieved, on the class page each student can view how they are performing on a leader board of their class mates in terms of total questions answered and total questions correct. In addition, students are giving a working grade estimate which is a countrywide comparison tool.  

3. As a student I want to receive feedback for an incorrect question to understand what I have done: 

Partially Achieved, If you answer a question incorrectly then the site will provide you with a method to follow or a hint that will enable you to answer that question. However, this hint is generic for all users, this could be further improved on by having a bank of common incorrect answers and an appropriate response based on the incorrect answer.  

4. As a student I want to see how well I am doing: 

Achieved, the students profile page has a pie chart showing percentage of correctly answered questions for a clear and immediate update. The profile page also includes some basic statistics of how the student is performing as well as a working grade. Finally, a progress bar for each module is at the bottom of the profile page so students can see how much they have left to complete.   

5. As a student I want to be motivated to return to the website: 

Partially Achieved, the profile page provides a progress bar to show users how much they have completed and to push them to try reach 100% completion in all modules. The class leader board also offers competition which is an incentive to return to the site.  

6. As a teacher I want to be easily able to view the progress of students in my class: 

Achieved, the teacher view of the class page shows an alphabetized (to represent class registers) table of data for the students showing working grades, questions attempted etc.  

7. Teachers want to be able to add and change questions easily to better suit their class 

Achieved, the profile page of the teacher allows them to view, add and edit there own questions.  

8. To be able communicate with my students using the website 

Not Achieved, adding a chat function/direct messaging function to allow teachers to message their students would have been ideal however it ended up being outside the scope of this project.  

9. As a teacher I want to know the experience previous schools/teachers have had using this website: 

Partially achieved, quotes on the homepage from past users highlight how some users have found success using the website.  

10. As a general user I want the purpose of the site to be immediately clear 

Achieved, clear hero image and captions demonstrate the side is about education and the name of the site/quotes make it clear it is a physics revision site.  

11. As a general user I want the site to be intuitive to use and navigate around: 

Achieved, icons change colour if they are hyperlinks, nav bar is clearly labelled and easy to use, it is always clear which part of the site you are on and how to navigate to a different page.   

12. As a general user I want the site be easily able to sign up/login to the site 

Achieved, clear navigation bar and sign up button make it easy to find and the form is structured clearly with clear instructions for the requirements of each part of the form that needs completing.
